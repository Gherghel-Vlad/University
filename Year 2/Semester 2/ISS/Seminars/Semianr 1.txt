It s important that in projects involving many participants, often of different tehnical backgrounds to use notations that enable us to articulate complex ideas 
succintly and precisely. 
UML is a notation that has  the goal to provide the standard notation that can be used by all OO methods.


System development focus on 3 different models of the system:
1. Functional model -> use case diagrams
2. object model -> class diagrams
3. Dynamic model -> interaction diagrams - activity diagrams
					 - comunication diagrams
		 -> state machine diagrams 
		 -> activity diagrams
