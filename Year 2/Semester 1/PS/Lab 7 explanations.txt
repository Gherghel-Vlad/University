ideea on what theta might be
H0 null hypothesis - takes into account the past
H1 - alternative hyp. - the "new" thing

H0 vs H1

Regarding vocabulary
accept H0
or
reject H0
		in favor H1


Technically: 
Choose a simple H0,
then H1 can be chosen from the following: (theta0 is usually given)
	H0 : theta = theta0
	H1: - theta < theta0 (left-tailed test)
	    - theta > theta0 (right-tailed test)
	    - theta =/= theta0 (two-tailed test)


alpha in (0, 1) - significance level
	usually: 1%, 5%, 10%
TS - test statistic 
TS0 - TS when your unknown variable is replaced with your known variable (theta = theta0)
	- observed value of TS
	- is a number
RR - rejection region 
	- has all the values of TS for which we reject H0
P - value - the critical of the test
	- minimum threshold for rejection

Hypothesis testing:
if TS0 belongs to RR reject H0
  else (TS0 doesn't belong to RR) do not reject H0



WE REQUEST: PRINT the follwing quantaties  TS0, RR, P-value

% INPUT
% X - the vector that contains your data
% M - test value (theta0 (in our case is niu (9)))
% SIGMA - standard deviation for the population 
% ALPHA - significance level 
% TAIL - indicates the type of the test

% OUTPUT
% H - tells us if we reject H0 or not
% P - P-value of the test (we shall print it at the end)
% CI - confidence interval
% ZVAL - observed value of TS (TS0 - we shall print it)

[H,P,CI,ZVAL] = ztest(X,M,SIGMA,ALPHA,TAIL)
