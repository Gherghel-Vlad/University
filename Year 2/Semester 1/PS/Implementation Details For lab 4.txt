
For a:

Ask the user for the p that is our probability
Ask the user for the number of simulations (N)
Inside U generate a vector of N random numbers
X = (U < p)
U_X = unique(X) (reduced duplicates)
n_X = hist(X,length(U_X)) (how many aparations of 0 and 1 we have)
rel_freq = n_X/N (the relative frequencies)


For b:

U X
Ask the user for n and p
Ask the user for the number of simulations (N)
Implement a for circle where i goes from 1 to big N that contains 2 lines: 
	1. Define U as a vector of random number length n
	2. X(i) = sum(U<p)
Using the 3 lines that he had written inside the meeting (last 3 lines for a) draw a plot: 
	inside compare the graph of uniques in X with the relative frequencies in comparison of the binopfd with parameters n and p
