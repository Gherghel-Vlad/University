"""
    We try to write a program to play Tic Tac Toe (XO)
     - human vs. computer
     - computer makes valid moves (not smart, but valid)
     - modular programming !?

    --------
    - user interface (read input, show the board, bla bla)
    - make a move (human - read from input, computer !?)
    - when is the game finished?
    What's our entity?
        1. board
        OR
        2. Slot (board aggregates slots)
