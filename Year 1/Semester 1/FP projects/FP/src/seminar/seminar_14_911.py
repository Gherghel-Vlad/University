Egyptian Fraction Representantion

Every positive fraction can be represented as sum of unique unit fractions. A fraction is unit fraction if numerator is 1 and denominator is a positive integer, for example 1/3 is a unit fraction. Such a representation is called Egyptian Fraction as it was used by ancient Egyptians.

Following are few examples:

Egyptian Fraction Representation of 6/14 is 1/3 + 1/11 + 1/231
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 12/13 is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/12 + 1/156

How do we compute the Egyptian Fraction Representation of 4/5?

It's simple

Egyptian_Fraction = []

We start by computing the ceil value* of the inverse of our fraction (5/4) ---> math.ceil(5/4)=2

So 2 will be the denominator of the the first unit fraction

REMEMBER! Every unit fraction has numerator=1 
(so the fraction is reduced to a form where denominator is greater than numerator 
    and numerator does not divide denominator.) 

Egyptian_Fraction = [1/2]

4/5=1/2+s ----> s=4/5-1/2 ----> s=(2*4)/(2*5)-(5*1)/(5*2) ----> s=3/10

Now we start again until the numerator becomes 1

math.ceil(10/3)=4

3/10=1/4+s ----> s=3/10-1/4 ----> s=(4*3)/(4*10)-(10*1)/(10*4) ----> s=2/40 ----> s=1/20

Egyptian_Fraction = [1/2, 1/4]

We notice that s=1/20 has the numerator 1, so we will stop and s will be the last unit fraction

Egyptian_Fraction = [1/2, 1/4, 1/20]

SO, The Egyptian Fraction Representation of 4/5 is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/20 

ceil value*= the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.

-= Weighted interval scheduling =-

You have to schedule N jobs on a computer. Each job is represented by following elements:
    1. Start Time (s_i)
    2. Finish Time (f_i)
    3. Value (v_i, >= 0)
Find the subset of jobs with maximum value, so that no two jobs in overlap

e.g.
# All jobs we want to schedule (start, end, value)
jobs = [(0, 3, 3), (1, 4, 2), (0, 5, 4), (3, 6, 1), (4, 7, 2), (3, 9, 5), (5, 10, 2), (8, 10, 1)]

Problem statement:
    Suppose we have n people and n tasks. Each person will solve exactly one task. If task i is solved by person j,
    the efficiency of solving the task is a[i][j]. Our goal is to maximize the total efficiency by attributing tasks
    optimally. The total efficiency is obtained by adding up all the efficiencies from all of our solved tasks.

    Constraints: 1 <= n <= 18
                 1 <= a[i][j] <= 100

    Input: n - number of people and tasks
           a - n lines with n values each. jth value from ith line denotes a[i][j]

    Output: the maximum efficiency

    {1, 2, 3, 4}
    {1, 3}
    0101

    Example:
        input

        3
        1 1 2
        1 2 1
        2 1 1

        output
        6

        (first task - third person)    = 2
        (second task - second person)  = 2
        (third task - first person)    = 2

        TOTAL EFFICIENCY               = 6
