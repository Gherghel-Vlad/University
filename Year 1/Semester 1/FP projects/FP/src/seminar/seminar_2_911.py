"""
Write an application that manages a list of students.
Each student has a unique id (string), a name (string) and a grade (integer, between 1 and 10).
The application will have a menu-driven user interface and will provide the following features:

    1. Add a student
        - adds the student with the given id, name and grade to the list.
        - error if giving existing id, the name or grade fields not given or empty

    2. Delete a student
        - deletes the student with the given id from the list
        - error if non-existing id given

    3. Show all students
        - shows all students
        (bonus: sort students in descending order of name or grade)

    4. Show students whose grade is > than given one
        (bonus: sort students by descending order of grade)

    5. exit
        - exit the program

    - how we represent each student?
    - how we divide program into functions?
    - how functions talk to each other
    - function specification
    - simple feature-driven development
        -> pick a feature and implement it !
    - each function does only one thing!



    - no global variables!
    - how do we represent 1 student as a str?
    - how do we print out a list of students?
