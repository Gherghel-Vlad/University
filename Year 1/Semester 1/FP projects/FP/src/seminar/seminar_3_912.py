"""
    1. Add Exceptions where it makes sense
    2. Turn into command-line app
    3. Add some unit tests

    -> We do add student together
    add 999, Popa Marian, 5

    requirements:
        - unique ID (int)
        - name length > 3
        - grade is int between 1 and 10


    -> You try to implement delete by yourselves
    delete 2,3,4,5 # deletes students having one of the given id's
    delete 2 - 6  # deletes students where 2 <= id <= 6


Write an application that manages a list of students.
Each student has a unique id (int), a name (string) and a grade (integer).
The application will provide the following features:

    1. Add a student
        - adds the student with the given id, name and grade to the list.
        - error if giving existing id, the name or grade fields not given or empty

    2. Delete a student
        - deletes the student with the given id from the list
        - error if non-existing id given

    3. Show all students
        - shows all students
        (bonus: sort students in descending order of name or grade)

    4. Show students whose grade is > than given one
        (bonus: sort students by descending order of grade)

    5. exit
        - exit the program
