UML field visibility
    + means public (everyone can call)
    # means protected (can be called in same package or from derived classes)
    - means private (cannot be called from outside of class)
    
Java/C++/C#
    you have keywords (public, protected, private)
Python
    _, __ implicit protected or private
    doesn't start with - means public

CarTextRepo inherits from Repository

class CarTextRepo(Repository):
    pass
    
What does this means?
    - CarTextRepo has all the attributes, properties and methods of the Repository class
    - isinstance(car_text_repo, Repository) -> True
    - wherever you've used Repository for storing cars, you should get away with using CarTextRepo
    
CarTextRepo
    - stores Car instances in a text file
    - text file name provided through class constructor
    - _load_file -> called on program start up (in class constrcutor)
    - _save_file -> called on every car change  

What you need to do (for attendance, bonus?)
    1. Implement the given class diagram
        1 set of Repositories based on text-files
        1 set of Repositories based on Pickle
    2. Integrate both into seminar_09_912
        (run the Undo*Example, only without the undo)
    3. Upload into seminar repo, seminar_10 folder
