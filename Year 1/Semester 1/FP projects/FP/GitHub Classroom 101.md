# Tutorial 1: Working with GitHub Classroom
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one). Name it using the `<group>_<family_name>_<given name>` format (e.g. 911_Popescu_Marian). Doing so will help us more easily find your work (**pro tip**: you can change this username after you no longer need it for University for your own projects; also, you can use GitHub to host other, non-FP related source code).
2. Accept the assignments for laboratory and seminar work that we make available on MS Teams. **When you do this for the first time, you will have to link your GitHub account with your Group/Name, by selecting it from a list**
3. You should have access to your own private GitHub repository, where you will code the solutions to the given assignments, `commit` and `push` the source code.
4. Start by checking out the following tutorials.
- [GitHub Classroom Student Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gbKzNlWNAk)
- [GitHub Desktop Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop)
5. For each assignment, the workflow should be:
- Receive the assignment via a link provided in MS Teams
- `Clone` the assignment repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop (**the easiest way**), the git command line, or directly using an IDE. 
- `Commit` your solution to the local repository. You can do this using GitHub Desktop or an IDE (**[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**,  **[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)** or many others).
- `Push` the solution to GitHub. This updates the GitHub-hosted repository with your changes, and allows us to see what you've been working on.
